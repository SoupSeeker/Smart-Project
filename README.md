# Smart-Project
452 smart contract auditing project
downloaded nodejs
downloaded truffle suite and ganache
using truffle to init the files and do initial deploy
using ganache as a visual helper for presentation / transactions
using remix.ethereum.org to write the solidity code and create transactions


in remix.ethereum.org, once you have ganache started and initialized with truffle files,
you can go to the Deploy & Run Transaction tab to set enviornment to Ganache Provider, link the 
local host with correct port and you can see your transactions in Ganache


*also be sure to put the Attack.sol contents directly under the ReEntrancy.sol contents when doing testing,
the files aren't deployed to an actual network so I dont think you can import them correctly

might be able to use digitalocean to install truffle/ganache to host the blockchain!
